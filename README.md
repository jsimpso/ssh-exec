# ssh-exec
This script will allow the user to execute multiple commands against multiple SSH enabled devices.  In its current state, it's used for connecting to Cisco switches / routers - but with a bit of tweaking could be applied to any number of other devices.   The output can either be displayed in your terminal screen, written to a file, or sent via email (with a bit of extra configuration)
